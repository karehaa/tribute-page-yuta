# tribute-page-yuta
Making another tribute. now im making full use of flexbox!
This is my last project for this 30 days Project
I see great improvement on this.
tho it takes me 30 + 2 days more to finish this. but it is still count as my 30th project!
And i will not stop here. Will continue and explore more.
Todays onwards the file name wont be using "Days ..." rather will use project name.
Im really proud on this one. its quite tidy and responsive!!
